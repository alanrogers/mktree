mktree: Generate a tree using the coalescent, and describe the result
with PicTex. 
 
1. Type "make depend" to generate the dependencies file.

2. Type "make" to compile the program.

3. Edit the file pophist.ini to make it reflect the history of the
hypothetical population in which you are interested.  The pophist.ini file
has a row for each epoch of the population's history.  There can
be as many rows (corresponding to as many epochs) as you want.  Within each
epoch, all parameters are constant.  Within each row, there are four
columns:
  column 1: the variable theta = 2*N*u, where N is haploid population
            size and u is the mutation rate per generation.
            In other words, theta measures population size in units
            of 1/(2*u) individuals.
  column 2: mn = m*n, where \"m\" is the immigration rate and \"n\" is\n\
            the haploid size of each subdivision. This parameter equals\n\
            the number of immigrants per generation into each population.\n\
  column 3: The length of the epoch in units of 1/(2*u) generations.
  column 4: The number of sub-populations, all of equal size.
The input routine ignores comments, which begin with '%' and end with
end-of-line.

4. To generate a tree with 20 tips, type:

  ./mktree 20 > figxxx.tex

On unix, this puts the output into a file called figxxx.tex.  If you
are working on windows, open an MSDOS session, get into the relevant
directory, and type

  mktree 20 > figxxx.tex

which does the same thing.  

To do anything useful with this output, you must have a working version of 
LaTeX, including support for PicTeX.  Assuming that you do, the next step is:

5. Type

  latex mkfig

to process the file mkfig.tex, which in turn imports the file figxxx.tex,
which you just created.  The result is a file called mkfig.dvi.  You can view this file using, for example, the program xdvi, or convert it into postscript
using the program dvips.

Under unix/linux, try this:

  ./mktree 30 ; latex mkfig; xdvi mkfig

A figure should appear on your screen.  Then hit the up-arrow followed by
return  The result is a file called mkfig.dvi.  You can view this file using, for example, the program xdvi, or convert it into postscript
using the program dvips.
